Autonomous vehicales have to predict what will happen in the environment around them to be able to be successful. That is because humans also, while driving, take predict what will happen around them and act accordingly. The paper states that there are 4 methods to prediction: " physics-based methods, classic machine learning-based methods, deep learning-based methods, and reinforcement learning-based methods". The physics model is a much more simple method that involves looking at the kinematics and motions of the vehicles to predict the vehicles trajectory. Physics based models are easy but not really accurate. They are only successful for 1 second or less. Using a combination of physics models and learning models will result in more accurate results. Machine learning models tend to be more accurate, with more variables included. Deep Learning models are even more accurate with "state of the art results". A reinforcement model involves more human-like thinking, which would predict in a more human like manner

This paper, though focused on autonomous vehicles, will have a good correlation to this project because this paper discusses the 4 major methods that can be used to approach trajectory prediction. These methods can also be used to predict where a plane will be. Though if we were to lose connection to them, a mix between the reinforcement model and the machine learning model would make the best approach as it performs like a human but is able to have a more accurate prediction for a greater amount of time.
