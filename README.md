# Flight Prediction (DMCP) Package

## Overview
This package contains work from The Data Mine Corporate Partners Sandia team. Our primary objective is to predict the destination of a flight trajectory given an incomplete locational history. We achieve this by considering historical flight patterns, which are stored in a raster-like grid (minimum dimensions of 2, lattitude and longitude). The prediction process involves comparing the flight of interest to this historical grid to produce a destination likelihood list.

## Features
- Prediction of flight destinations based on partial trajectory data
- Utilization of historical flight patterns
- Storage of flight data in a raster-like grid structure
- Comparison algorithm to generate destination likelihood

## Usage
To run the code, navigate to the `src/` directory and execute:
`python3 conductor.py`
## Project Structure
