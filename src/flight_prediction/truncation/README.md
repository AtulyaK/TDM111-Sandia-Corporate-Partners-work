Pickle files are saved in the /anvil/projects/tdm/corporate/sandia-trajectory/previous_files/flight/data/2023_2024/truncatedTrajectories/ directory. They are organized by day, with 1.5 months of data total; 15 days from 04-01-2013 to 04-15-2013 and 28 days from 02-01-2015 to 02-28-2015. Each item in each file is a dictionary of the form origin (String), destination (String), full flight (Tracktable trajectoryTerrestrial), truncated flight (Tracktable trajectoryTerrestrial), and the percent remaining (float) in decimal form - example: 0.35, which is 35% of the original flight. These are randomly generated increments of 5% between 5% and 75%, where 5% is the minimum remaining portion of the flight and 75% is the maximum remaining after truncation. These can be accessed with the following tags: ["Origin", "Destination", "Full", "Partial", "Percent"].
